# Learn Go Programming

This repository is structured to help you learn Go programming from basic principles to advanced concepts. It follows a progressive learning path inspired by the [roadmap.sh Go roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-roadmaps/mastering-go-programming-language-xfizh) and standard Go learning resources.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Start with the basics in the `01-basics` directory and progress through each section.
4. Each directory contains example code and exercises to practice what you've learned.

## Learning Path

### 1. Go Basics

Start with the fundamentals of Go programming, including syntax, variables, control structures, and functions.

### 2. Data Structures

Learn how to work with various data structures in Go, from built-in types like arrays and maps to custom types with structs.

### 3. Advanced Concepts

Explore more advanced features of Go, including interfaces, error handling, and concurrency with goroutines and channels.

### 4. Practical Go

Apply your knowledge to practical tasks like file operations, working with JSON, and building HTTP clients and servers.

### 5. Projects

Build complete applications to solidify your understanding of Go and gain practical experience.
