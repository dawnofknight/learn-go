# Concurrency in Go

This section covers concurrency in Go, which is one of the language's standout features. Go's concurrency model is based on goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels (communication between goroutines), making it easier to write concurrent programs that are both efficient and safe.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Goroutines

- Basic goroutine usage
- Multiple goroutines
- Capturing loop variables
- Goroutine lifecycle

### 2. Channels

- Basic channel operations (send and receive)
- Buffered channels
- Channel directions (send-only, receive-only)
- Closing channels
- Ranging over channels

### 3. Select Statement

- Waiting on multiple channels
- Non-blocking channel operations
- Timeouts with select
- Default case in select

### 4. Synchronization Primitives

- Mutex for mutual exclusion
- RWMutex for read/write locks
- WaitGroup for waiting on multiple goroutines
- Once for one-time initialization

### 5. Context Package

- Cancellation
- Timeouts
- Deadlines
- Values

### 6. Concurrency Patterns

- Worker pools
- Fan-out, fan-in
- Pipelines
- Rate limiting
- Semaphores

### 7. Advanced Patterns

- Graceful shutdown
- Timeout handling
- Error propagation in concurrent code
- Atomic operations

## Running the Program

To run the program, navigate to this directory and execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, not the operating system. They allow concurrent execution with minimal resources.

2. **Channels**: The primary mechanism for communication between goroutines. They provide a way to send and receive values with synchronization built in.

3. **Select**: Allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channel operations, choosing the first one that's ready.

4. **Synchronization**: Various primitives like Mutex, WaitGroup, and Once help coordinate goroutines and prevent race conditions.

5. **Context**: A standard way to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and request-scoped values across API boundaries and between goroutines.

6. **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**: Concurrency is about structure (dealing with multiple things at once), while parallelism is about execution (doing multiple things at once).

7. **Share Memory By Communicating**: Instead of sharing memory and using locks, Go encourages communicating through channels to share data.

## Best Practices

1. **Don't create goroutines without knowing how they will end**: Ensure all goroutines have a way to terminate, or they may cause memory leaks.

2. **Use buffered channels when appropriate**: They can help decouple goroutines and improve performance in certain scenarios.

3. **Always check for race conditions**: Use the `-race` flag when testing to detect race conditions.

4. **Prefer channels over shared memory and locks**: This leads to more maintainable and less error-prone code.

5. **Use context for cancellation**: It provides a standard way to propagate cancellation signals across goroutine boundaries.

6. **Be careful with closures in goroutines**: Always capture loop variables explicitly to avoid unexpected behavior.

7. **Consider the number of goroutines**: While goroutines are lightweight, creating too many can still impact performance.

## Exercises

1. Implement a concurrent web crawler that respects rate limits and timeouts.

2. Create a pipeline that processes data in multiple stages concurrently.

3. Build a chat server that handles multiple clients concurrently using goroutines and channels.

4. Implement a concurrent file processor that reads, processes, and writes files in parallel.

5. Create a worker pool that processes jobs from a queue with configurable concurrency limits.

6. Implement a timeout mechanism for a long-running operation using context and select.

7. Build a concurrent cache with expiration and automatic cleanup of expired items.
