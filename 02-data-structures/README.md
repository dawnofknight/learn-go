# Go Data Structures

This section covers the fundamental data structures in Go. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific data structure or related concept.

## Topics Covered

### 01-arrays

Working with fixed-size arrays in Go.

### 02-slices

Understanding slices, Go's dynamic arrays, and their operations.

### 03-maps

Using maps (hash tables) for key-value data.

### 04-structs

Defining custom data types with structs.

### 05-interfaces

Implementing and using interfaces for polymorphism.

### 06-pointers

Understanding pointers and memory management in Go.

### 07-json

Working with JSON data in Go.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Create and manipulate arrays and slices
- Use maps for key-value data storage
- Define custom data types with structs
- Implement and use interfaces
- Understand pointers and memory management
- Marshal and unmarshal JSON data

## Getting Started

Start with the `01-arrays` directory and work your way through each topic in order. Each directory contains example code and exercises to practice what you've learned.
